## NextGenAS Loan Payment Calculator - Markup and Styles

This example uses real markup and styles, and we'll learn how transpiled ActionScript can query the HTML DOM to access elements at runtime. Combine HTML, CSS, and ActionScript, and take advantage of the strengths of all three.

## Requirements

Apache FlexJS 0.6 or newer

## Build Instructions

Run the following command in the root directory of this example:

```
asjsc src/LoanPaymentCalculator.as
```

To run, open `index.html` in your web browser.
