# NextGenAS HTML Loan Payment Calculator Examples

This set of [NextGen ActionScript](http://nextgenactionscript.com/) examples demonstrates three different ways of using HTML with transpiled ActionScript. In each example, we'll build the same simple "loan payment calculator" widget in HTML, but we'll approach the same problem differently each time.

## Part 1: ActionScript Only

In the first example, we build our widget by creating all of the HTML elements dynamically with ActionScript code. By starting at a low-level, we see how well transpiled code integrates with the web browser.

## Part 2: Markup and Styles

The next example uses real markup and styles, and we'll learn how transpiled ActionScript can query the HTML DOM to access elements at runtime. Combine HTML, CSS, and ActionScript, and take advantage of the strengths of all three.

## Part 3: Material Design Lite

In the final example, learn how easily we can take advantage of popular CSS libraries by integrating Google's [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) library.
