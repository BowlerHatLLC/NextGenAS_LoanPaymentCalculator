## NextGenAS Loan Payment Calculator - ActionScript Only

In the first example, we build our loan payment calculator widget by creating all of the HTML elements dynamically with ActionScript code. By starting at a low-level, we see how well transpiled code integrates with the web browser.

## Requirements

Apache FlexJS 0.6 or newer

## Build Instructions

Run the following command in the root directory of this example:

```
asjsc src/LoanPaymentCalculator.as
```

To run, open `index.html` in your web browser.
